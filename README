XML-FromArrayref

The previously existing XML generation modules, such as XML::Writer, aren't
really that expressive or concise in use, so here's a simple module that
takes a list of arrayrefs and renders them as XML elements, replacing any
whose tag names are false with their contents.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
